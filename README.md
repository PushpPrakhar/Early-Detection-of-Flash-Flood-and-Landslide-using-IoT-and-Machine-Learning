## 🧭 Overview

Flash floods and landslides are sudden and destructive natural disasters, especially prevalent in mountainous terrains such as the Himalayas. Traditional systems fail to provide timely alerts due to lack of real-time data and predictive capability.

This project integrates:
- **IoT-based sensor networks** for environmental monitoring
- **Machine learning models** for real-time prediction
- **Alert mechanisms** (SMS, buzzer, LED indicators) for emergency communication
