## üß≠ Overview

Flash floods and landslides are sudden and destructive natural disasters, especially prevalent in mountainous terrains such as the Himalayas. Traditional systems fail to provide timely alerts due to lack of real-time data and predictive capability.

This project integrates:
- **IoT-based sensor networks** for environmental monitoring
- **Machine learning models** for real-time prediction
- **Alert mechanisms** (SMS, buzzer, LED indicators) for emergency communication

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Deploy and power the sensor nodes**  
   - Connect rainfall, soil moisture, vibration, and water level sensors to your ESP32/Arduino board.  
   - Ensure power is supplied via battery or solar panel in field conditions.

2. **Data Transmission**  
   - Sensor readings are collected by the microcontroller.
   - Data is sent to the local server or cloud (depending on connectivity).

3. **Real-Time ML Prediction**  
   - The `run_inference.py` script continuously analyzes incoming data using trained machine learning models.
   - Each data point is classified into one of three risk categories:  
     - `0`: Safe  
     - `1`: Warning  
     - `2`: Critical  

4. **Risk-Based Alerting**  
   - If risk level is `Warning` or `Critical`:
     - üö® Buzzer and LEDs are activated for immediate local notification.
